# AI Tool
- I used ChatGPT 5 to assist me with the implementation of the A-Star algorithm
- I copied the 'Task' part of the assignment PDF and uploaded the example data
- ChatGPT gave me two responses, I chose the one with the cleaner output that I personally liked more (both seemed to have 
correctly implemented the algorithm though)
- This code worked with zero modification at all, I verified the code was correctly returning the shortest paths by 
drawing out the graphs on paper and comparing ( The images are also uploaded )
- The only thing needed to add to the code were comments so I could know what exactly the code does, without looking 
through and adding comments to see how the code worked I wouldn't know how to implement the algorithm on my own

# AI Strengths
- Writing the Astar algorithm exactly how I wanted
- very easy to copy and paste the prompt + drag and drop the .data files 

# AI Weaknesses
- very specific prompt was needed as well as the data files, if the data files were too large and represented a giant
graph, they wouldn't be able to be uploaded and the output wouldn't be as intended
- I find it easier to write the code myself and have AI help me rather than have AI write the code and have to debug
for hours
- Lack of explanation on how the code works, so it's more understandable for someone who doesn't know what Astar does

# Running the code (from a terminal in the same folder the program is in)
- python3 a_star_assignment.py example-1.data
- python3 a_star_assignment.py example2-1.data
- make sure the python file and all the data files are in the same folder


# Write-up 
The AI tool I used (ChatGPT) did very well for this project. The only real thing that required human intervention is 
the code review. This is where I read through to understand what was written and added comments for future people to 
be able to understand the AI generated code. This was definitely done way faster with the fact that the AI implemented 
the Astar algorithm on its first attempt. To be fair, it did have a very specific prompt on the instructions and what the 
input data would look like. This will definitely affect the job market for software engineers. Entry-level software 
engineers are probably at a similar level to some AI models. I think it'll change the job market drastically and entry
level roles will care more about prompting the AI and having a fundamental understanding of how software works rather than
writing code that works good. Also, being able to debug and pick out what exactly error AI might've had will also be a 
key trait to have when entering the software engineering field.
